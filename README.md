### Geography

I was born in *khorram abad* a city in the west of I.R.I where from there we moved to Tehran that I barely remember how. I am now living in Tehran, enjoying my learning path, reading books, web-browsing, watching TV series and continuing to be a **life-long student**.


### Passions and Goals

I love to be seen as a scientist for the most part and an emotional dreamer, well, for the less part. I am into mathematical abstractions, philosophical debates, quantum physics, artifical intelligence, psychology  and Zen Buddhism. I'm an avid reader, and most of my time, I'm actually studying subjects to subjects in an un-ending roll, love animals, hearing indie musics, a movie-fanatic I am, long-time-into-video-games, not a people-person and soon-to-be data scientist<3.


### Some of the books, movies and hobbies I adore

Third Policeman by *Flan O'Brien* is by far my favorite book, I do love *Kundera*'s works as well, my favourite soccer team is Internazionale, Dota 2 is my short time escapism, *Massive Attack, Beirut*and *Gorillaz* are my attachment to the music and *The Master* is my favourite movie.
